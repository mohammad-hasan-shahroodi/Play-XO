# XO - modern code :
in this code you make table with tow functions and also I use for a different list:
###
tow functions : 
```python
def init_table(A):
    home = 1
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            A[i][j] = home
            home+=1
def print_table(A):
    print("+---+---+---+")
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            print("|", A[i][j] , end= " ")
        print("|",end= " ")
        print()
        print("+---+---+---+")
    print()
```
- list :
```python
A = [[0]*3 for i in range(3)]
```
- Sort the list :
```python
```python
def init_table(A):
    home = 1
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            A[i][j] = home
            home+=1
def print_table(A):
    print("+---+---+---+")
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            print("|", A[i][j] , end= " ")
        print("|",end= " ")
        print()
        print("+---+---+---+")
    print()
```
